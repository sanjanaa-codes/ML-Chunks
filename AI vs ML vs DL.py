ðŸ“˜ AI vs ML vs DL
ðŸ”¹ Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Definition: The ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence (like decision-making, problem-solving, or speech recognition).
Example:
Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa that understand commands.
Self-driving cars making driving decisions.

ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (ML)

Definition: A subset of AI where machines learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
Example:
Spam filters in Gmail learning from flagged emails.
Netflix recommendations improving based on your watch history.

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning (DL)

Definition: A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to learn and make decisions from complex data.

Example:
Facial recognition on Facebook/Instagram.
Voice assistants understanding natural speech.

| Scope       | Broad: Any smart system      | Subset of AI: learns from data     | Subset of ML: learns via neural networks |
| Human-like? | Mimics intelligence          | Learns from experience             | Learns like a brain (neurons & layers)   |
| Data Need   | Can work with rules          | Needs structured data              | Needs huge amounts of data               |
| Example     | Siri, Chess bots             | Spam filter, Recommendation system | Self-driving cars, Face recognition      |
