Supervised learning mainly deals with two kinds of problems:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Classification

Definition: Predicting a category (discrete output).
The model learns from labeled data and assigns new input to a specific class.

Examples:

Classifying an image as Male or Female.
Email: Spam or Not Spam.
Handwriting recognition: digits 0â€“9.
Analogy: Like sorting fruits into baskets (apple basket, mango basket).
âœ… Output Type â†’ Categorical (Yes/No, Class A/B/C)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Regression

Definition: Predicting a continuous value (numeric output).
The model learns relationships between variables to estimate numerical outcomes.

Examples:

Predicting temperature tomorrow.
Estimating rainfall in cm.
House price prediction.
Analogy: Like estimating your exam score based on study hours.
âœ… Output Type â†’ Continuous values (real numbers)

| Problem Type   | Output Nature | Example Question              | Example Application        | Analogy               |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Classification | Categorical   | Is this email spam?           | Spam filter, Gender detect | Sorting fruits        |
| Regression     | Continuous    | What will be the house price? | Stock prediction, Weather  | Predicting exam score |
