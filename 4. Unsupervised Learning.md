Definition:
Unsupervised learning is when the model works on unlabeled data (no predefined output).
It tries to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Unsupervised Learning
1. Clustering

Definition: Grouping similar data points together into clusters, without predefined labels.

Examples:
Customer segmentation in marketing (grouping customers based on buying behavior).
Document/topic clustering (news articles grouped by topics).
Image segmentation (separating objects in an image).
Analogy: Like arranging books in a library by similarity (mystery, romance, science) without knowing the genres in advance.
âœ… Output â†’ Groups (clusters)

2. Association

Definition: Finding relationships or associations between variables in large datasets.

Examples:

Market Basket Analysis: "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter too."
Online recommendation systems: Netflix suggests movies based on viewing patterns.
Retail sales data: Discovering frequent product combinations.
Analogy: Like noticing people who order pizza also often buy cold drinks.
âœ… Output â†’ Rules & patterns (X â†’ Y)
