🔹 1. Supervised Learning

Definition: ML with labeled data (input + correct output already known). The model learns to map input → output

Example:
Feeding the model pictures labeled as “Apple” and “Mango”, so it can later classify new fruit images.
Predicting house prices based on past data (size, location → price).
Analogy: Like a teacher guiding a student with correct answers.

🔹 2. Unsupervised Learning

Definition: ML with unlabeled data (only inputs, no predefined output). The model finds hidden patterns, clusters, or structures.

Example:
Grouping customers into segments for marketing (without knowing their categories beforehand).
Google News clustering similar articles together.
Analogy: Like being given a box of mixed fruits without labels and figuring out categories yourself.

🔹 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Definition: ML where an agent interacts with an environment, takes actions, and learns through rewards or penalties to maximize long-term rewards.

Key terms:
Agent → the learner/decision-maker (e.g., robot, game bot).
Environment → where the agent operates.
Action → what the agent does.
Reward → feedback (positive/negative) to guide learning.

Example:
Training a robot to walk: reward for moving forward, penalty for falling.
Game AI (like AlphaGo): learns winning moves by trial & error.
Analogy: Like teaching a dog tricks with treats as rewards.
